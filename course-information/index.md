We are considering two possible incarnations of this course in Waterloo's curriculum at the moment. We'll initially just be testing this out with interested students in the [Software Enginering faculty](http://softeng.uwaterloo.ca), and expanding to include CS and possibly CE students later.

TODO: I just copy-pasted the stuff from the brainstorming Google Doc. Must polish it up a bit.

# Lecture Topics

As SE 498, greater emphasis will be placed on traditional learning of course material, drawn from the topics below. SE 499 will still feature weekly meetings where topics below may be covered, but will be more project-oriented.

- version control, DVCS
- build systems
- test harnesses
- continuous integration / deployment
- architecture of major projects
- social factors: motivations, collaboration, standardization, manners
- licensing
    - BSD, MIT, GPL, LGPL, EPL, LPPI, OSI
- business models
    - ghostscript
    - Rob O'Callahan (1 project, multiple employers)
      Linus Torvalds
      Guido van Rossum
    - RedHat
    - nocharge code, services, support
- When to open source?
- OS usability (Michael Terry)
- managing large FOSS projects
- history
    - BSD
    - Linux
    - GNU/FSF
    - Mozilla
    - Android
- key signing: management
- how to start / contributing
- learning large code bases / tools for reading

# As SE 498

- 3 hours / week
- 2 hours studying
- 5 hours programming
- Soonest: Winter 2014 (4B) (earlier only if there are volunteers (no teaching credit))
- exam
- committee approval
- easy to enroll
- larger # of students


## Marking Scheme

- Exam 30%
- Project 70% (alternatively, 60% project and 10% participation)
    - individual? group?
    - size of project
    - importance of contributions
    - contribution accepted
    - verification effort
    - documentation + presentation
    - peer evaluation

# As SE 499

- 1 hour / week meeting
- 9 hours / week programming
- report
- no exam
- don't need committee approval
- closer faculty attention
- Fall 2012
- harder to enroll (need to figure out project and supervisor before term starts)
- smaller number of students
- seminars and meetings before lecture begins to help people get projects
- find prof who find your project sufficiently interesting (eg. Patrick Lam) or in prof's research areas
- use prof hour for the matchmaking process

## Advantages over SE 499 by itself

- greater social cohesion, get a room with a meeting
- facilitate matchmaking process: students are excited about doing OSS and profs do research. Get those two groups to realize that they have a lot of overlap.
