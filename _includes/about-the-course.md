This is a full-credit course where students contribute to an open-source software project during an academic term. Students will have the freedom to:

- choose their project
- propose and scope their contribution
- define their own evaluation rubric by setting their own schedule and goals

Additionally, the course will offer a cohesive social and intellectual framework that will provide students with:

- a network of peers and professors to bounce ideas off
- an experienced professor mentor
- weekly instructional lectures
- guest speakers from industry and the open-source community

This is intended to introduce students to the world of open-source software development, and students will take away knowledge that they made a lasting impact on society while earning a course credit.
