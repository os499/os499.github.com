1. Work on exciting, widely-used projects such as Firefox, Chromium, WebKit, Apache, CPython, WordPress, Khan Academy, LLVM, jQuery, Linux, and more that have real-world impact as part of a standard course in school.
1. Earn a **credit** and have **course time to work on coding projects of your choice**!
1. Land an **internship or full-time offer** based on your contributions.
1. Learn software development practices, tools, and techniques, and have your code reviewed.
1. Network with other students and develop contacts in industry and the open-source community.
1. Have a substantial, public, open piece of code that you can show potential employers.
1. New to OSS? Get started in a guided environment with experienced professor mentors and fellow contributors.
1. Give back to the community that has made so much of what is modern-day programming possible.
1. Get involved in the open-source community and learn to collaborate on large projects with remote contributors.
1. Learn skills relevant to co-op and the software industry.
1. Students new to OSS can use this as an introduction and a way to get started, and continue contributing after the course is over. This course could create life-long OSS contributors.
1. Is very relevant to real software engineering.
1. Students gain experience and put OSS on their resumes.
1. Upon graduation, uWaterloo students gain another edge over other students in the job market.
1. Some of the most famous programmers are known because of their OSS contributions.
1. Gain exposure in the online community and build up a portfolio.
1. Students who wish to contribute but don't have the time or commitment to do it by themselves can receive guidance, mentorship, a network of peers, and a semi-structured course to assist them.
1. Soft Eng has a design project where students work collaboratively on a programming project by themselves. CS needs something practical and hands-on like this.
1. Develop a "hacker" community among programmers at Waterloo, like how VeloCity is Waterloo's entrepreneurial hub. Students meet and interact with other coders.
1. Waterloo would be better known in the software world.
1. Waterloo promotes itself as being innovative and risk-taking. This would likely be a unique course for which Waterloo could be a world leader.
1. A lot of fun!
