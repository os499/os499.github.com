1. Students can work on exciting projects like Firefox, Chromium, WebKit, Apache, CPython, WordPress, Khan Academy, LLVM, JQuery, Linux, and more, that have real-world impact as part of a standard course in school.
1. Students new to OSS can use this as an introduction and a way to get started, and continue contributing after the course is over. This course could create life-long OSS contributors.
1. Students learn skills relevant to co-op and the software industry.
1. Students could get an internship or full-time offer based on their contributions.
1. Is very relevant to real software engineering.
1. Being a course means that students can earn a credit and have course time to work on OSS.
1. Students gain experience and put OSS on their resumes.
1. Upon graduation, uWaterloo students gain another edge over other students in the job market.
1. Some of the best programmers have participated in the OSS community.
1. Students learn software development practices, tools, and techniques, and have their code reviewed (like co-op).
1. Students gain exposure in the online community and build up a portfolio.
1. Students who wish to contribute but don't have the time or commitment to do it by themselves can receive guidance, mentorship, a network of peers, and a semi-structured course to assist them.
1. Soft Eng has a design project where students work collaboratively on a programming project by themselves. CS needs something practical and hands-on like this.
1. Develop a "hacker" community among programmers at Waterloo, like how VeloCity is Waterloo's entrepreneurial hub. Students meet and interact with other coders.
1. Waterloo would be better known in the software world.
1. Waterloo promotes itself as being innovative and risk-taking. This would likely be a unique course for which Waterloo could be a world leader.
1. The programming community (including CS students) who make use of OSS should give back.
1. A lot of fun!
