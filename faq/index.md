## what course slot would this take?

for software engineers, this would take up an ATE. Know, however, that you can take more than 5 ATEs by taking 6 courses for one term or doing distance ed during co-op terms. Also know there are compelling alternatives to courses offered by Waterloo, for example Stanford's online AI course and Machine Learning courses.


# How is this different from [UCOSP](http://ucosp.ca)?
1. Integrated as a CS/SE course, with (short) weekly lectures and a professor and faculty members teaching, providing assistance to students, and grading.
1. Guest speakers and student presentations at lectures.
1. Group of students (maybe 10 - 40?) take this together from the same university.
1. Students can apply for projects outside of those registered for UCOSP.
1. Students can choose to contribute individually to projects.
1. Accepts a much larger group of students from the same university (UCOSP only has the means for 6-8 Waterloo students at the moment).

# How is this different from the Engineering Design Project?
1. Less restrictions and more flexible.
1. Depending on the project you get, you don't have to gather requirements, find a customer, find a business case, and such.
1. This would be strictly contributing to existing OSS, so students develop skills related to understanding and working on a large code base remotely with other developers and how the OSS community works.
1. Contributions have lasting impact on the real world (not implying that design projects don't).

## half-course spread out over two terms?

waterloo doesn't want this


## have students collectively work on a single project for school. eg. better jobmine, better uw-ace, etc.

we've thought about that, but the purpose and the spirit of the course is to introduce students to contributing to existing OSS software, workign remotely, immersing themselves in the established OSS community, and such. 

we will not be officially endorsing such an effort, but neither will we discourage it. Go right on ahead if you wish to organize such an effort.


## How can I contribute?

How appropriate for a course on open-source development to be itself open-sourced! This website is hosted on GitHub in its entirety. If you would like to make a contribution,

- fork on GitHub and send us a pull request
- discuss on our IRC channel
