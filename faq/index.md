title: OS 499 - FAQ
---

## Who is eligible?
For our Fall 2012 pilot, we'll primarily be accepting third- and fourth-year Software Engineering students taking SE 499. We also invite any self-motivated students from other faculties via your faculty's individual project course (CS 499, ECE 499, etc.), in the University of Waterloo.

The prerequite for all applicants is that you must have found a project you would like to contribute to and to have built it (ie. be able to run it locally on your computer, whether that means compiling it or running a server locally).

## How do I enroll?
To apply for our first pilot in the Fall 2012 term, please enroll as you would for your faculty's individual project course (SE 499, CS 499, ECE 499, etc.). This entails finding a faculty supervisor interested in your project or having an area of research related to your project.

## How do I find a project?
See the [resources page](/resources) as a starting point for finding projects.

The OS 499 organizers will be reaching out to professors for open-source projects they would like to mentor students on. We'll also be seeking industry collaborators in the near future, such as Khan Academy.

## How is this different from [UCOSP](http://ucosp.ca)?
1. Integrated as a CS/SE course, with (short) weekly lectures and a professor and faculty members teaching, providing assistance to students, and grading.
1. Guest speakers and student presentations at lectures.
1. Group of students (maybe 10 - 40?) take this together from the same university.
1. Students can apply for projects outside of those registered for UCOSP.
1. Students can choose to contribute individually to projects.
1. Accepts a much larger group of students from the same university (UCOSP only has the means for 6-8 Waterloo students at the moment).

## How is this different from the Engineering Design Project?
1. Less restrictions and more flexible.
1. Depending on the project you get, you don't have to gather requirements, find a customer, find a business case, and such.
1. This would be strictly contributing to existing OSS, so students develop skills related to understanding and working on a large code base remotely with other developers and how the OSS community works.
1. Contributions have lasting impact on the real world (not implying that design projects don't).

## what course slot would this take?

for software engineers, this would take up an ATE. Know, however, that you can take more than 5 ATEs by taking 6 courses for one term or doing distance ed during co-op terms. Also know there are compelling alternatives to courses offered by Waterloo, for example Stanford's online AI course and Machine Learning courses.

## half-course spread out over two terms?

waterloo doesn't want this


## have students collectively work on a single project for school. eg. better jobmine, better uw-ace, etc.

we've thought about that, but the purpose and the spirit of the course is to introduce students to contributing to existing OSS software, workign remotely, immersing themselves in the established OSS community, and such. 

we will not be officially endorsing such an effort, but neither will we discourage it. Go right on ahead if you wish to organize such an effort.


## How can I contribute?

How appropriate for a course on open-source development to be itself open-sourced! This website is hosted on GitHub in its entirety. If you would like to make a contribution,

- fork on GitHub and send us a pull request
- discuss on our IRC channel


## when is this offered

## am i eligible


## Why not SE 498?

TODO (put content from brainstorming google doc)
- working towrads it
- if this works, will do it
- started on the curriculum






## Brainstorming questions that students might have with Mack

- what are the prereqs?
- how do i apply
- what is this course
- when is it offered?
- does it have its own course code: cs 499, se 499
- is everybody meeting toghetr? if so where/when?
- se 499 marking scheme?
- how does it differ?
- find a project? yes or no?
    - mention khan academy
    - projects page?
    - have ppl enter their email to stay up to date? blog feed?
    - project owner?
    - student?
- which term to take? (same as 499: for se, charlie's approving third years)
- how are ppl finding this website?
- ATE? does this count as a CS or ECE ATE?
- can you get paid while doing this
- which room?
- who are students?
    - self motivated


- meeting time / room
- khan acaemy collaboraration/ helping ppl get their proejcts
- which term to take


- what is SE 499
- differences and similarities with SE 499
    - consistent markign scheme
    - consistent structure
