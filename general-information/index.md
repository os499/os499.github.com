This is a student-organized proposal for a course where students contribute to open-source software.

# The course

- Eligibility
  - Upper-year elective available to CS, Math, and Engineering students at the University of Waterloo
  - Core SE course?
- Project and mentor search
  - Students can find their own projects and mentors
    - There are OSS projects looking for student contribution. See Google Summer of Code (2011 list) and UCOSP
  - Students can also select from a list of projects curated by the lead professor
  - Lead professor can assist students in searching for projects and mentors
  - We will provide an information page or website that students can reference when applying to projects
  - Students should have their project selected before enrolling in the course
- Lectures
  - Weekly meetings
  - Initial lectures are presented by the lead professor, with later lectures given by students (like a grad course) or other faculty members.
  - Possible topics: OSS history, licenses, major projects, tools, advice for new contributors, software practices
  - The lead professor has contributed to open-source software and will help a subset of students find projects and mentors. The lead professor may also attempt to forge industry collaborations and get media coverage.
  - Guest speakers from the OSS community and industry
    - Linus Torvalds
    - Richard Stallman
    - Behdad Esfahbod, who is in Toronto and is fairly famous -PL 
    - John Resig, whose Processing.js was taken over by students at Seneca College 
  - Student presentations on topics in OSS or on their projects
- Project-oriented
  - Students are expected to be working on their project for the majority of the course time (10-12 weeks)
  - Estimated at least 10-hour commitment per week per student
  - Very flexible and open-ended. Students could contribute code, documentation, bug fixes, participate in a mailing list.
- Evaluation
  - Students will outline their objectives and set their own deadlines at the beginning of the course. This will be used as a basis for grading. Rationale: each project will vary and expected student contributions may vary as well, so rubric should vary accordingly
  - Evaluation could come from the following sources, depending on the student’s situation:
  - Source control commit logs and diff
  - Weekly snippets, email/newsgroup communications
  - Mentor evaluation
  - Peer evaluations (for team projects)
  - Final report - 5 Ws and interaction with community

# Rationale

1. Students can work on exciting projects like Firefox, Chromium, WebKit, Apache, CPython, WordPress, Khan Academy, LLVM, JQuery, Linux, etc. that have real-world impact, while in school.
1. Students new to OSS can use this as an introduction and a way to get started, and continue contributing after the course is over. This course could create life-long OSS contributors.
1. Students learn skills relevant to co-op and the software industry.
1. Students could get an internship or full-time offer based on their contributions.
1. Is very relevant to real software engineering.
1. Being a course means that students can earn a credit and have course time to work on OSS.
1. Students gain experience and put OSS on their resumes.
1. Upon graduation, uWaterloo students gain another edge over other students in the job market.
1. Some of the best programmers have participated in the OSS community.
1. Students learn software development practices, tools, and techniques, and have their code reviewed (like co-op).
1. Students gain exposure in the online community and build up a portfolio.
1. Students who wish to contribute but don't have the time or commitment to do it by themselves can receive guidance, mentorship, a network of peers, and a semi-structured course to assist them.
1. Soft Eng has a design project where students work collaboratively on a programming project by themselves. CS needs something practical and hands-on like this.
1. Develop a "hacker" community among programmers at Waterloo, like how VeloCity is Waterloo's entrepreneurial hub. Students meet and interact with other coders.
1. Waterloo would be better known in the software world.
1. Waterloo promotes itself as being innovative and risk-taking. This would likely be a unique course for which Waterloo could be a world leader.
1. The programming community (including CS students) who make use of OSS should give back.
1. This course could be a lot of fun!

 
# Differences between the Soft Eng design project

- Less restrictions and more flexible.
- Depending on the project you get, you don't have to gather requirements, find a customer, find a business case, and such.
- This would be strictly contributing to existing OSS, so students develop skills related to understanding and working on a large code base remotely with other developers and how the OSS community works.
- Contributions have lasting impact on the real world (not implying that design projects don't).


# Differences from what UCOSP currently offers

- Integrated as a CS/SE course, with (short) weekly lectures and a professor and faculty members teaching, providing assistance to students, and grading.
- Guest speakers and student presentations at lectures.
- Group of students (maybe 10 - 40?) take this together from the same university.
- Students can apply for projects outside of those registered for UCOSP.
- Students can choose to contribute individually to projects.
- Accepts a much larger group of students from the same university (UCOSP only has the means for 6-8 Waterloo students at the moment).


# 2012 pilots

**NOTE: The text in this section no longer applies. This will be updated soon.**

Professor Derek Rayside in ECE, who teaches primarily software engineering courses, has volunteered to lead the pilots. We are planning for two pilot runs in 2012: one in the Winter term and one in the Fall term. For both pilots, we are seeking motivated students who are self-driven and are capable of writing solid code - basically, don’t embarrass Waterloo.

## Winter term

For our first pilot we will have a small number (3-6) of highly committed students. Preferably, these students are from the Software Engineering 2012 class, with whom Prof Derek is already familiar. The idea is to have a small, manageable handful of students that Prof Derek can coordinate without expending as much effort as would be required for a regular course.
Students will be enrolling in SE 499 and will apply on an individual basis.

The goal of this pilot is to have successful student contributions that will make way for and validate:

## Fall term

All interested students are encouraged to apply, and there will be as many openings as qualified students. This will be mass-promoted to students in CS, SE, and CE. Interested 2014 Softies will be taking this course this term (their 3B term, which is purportedly a more manageable term than 3A). The goal is to enroll at least 20 students, which would qualify the lead professor for a teaching credit.

We will aim to have this accepted as SE 498, but we can always have students enroll in SE 499 should our bid be unsuccessful. Students will be applying on an individual basis.

# Goals

- Attain the goals of the pilots (see above). Further, 80% of students should successfully complete their projects and have them integrated upstream (GSoC started off with 80% - http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/ProgramStatistics)
- Becomes an official Waterloo offering, with its own course code
- Becomes a core SE course (maybe)
- Co-op is one of Waterloo's strong points. Like co-op, be another key advantage for Waterloo CS/SE students that Waterloo is known for.
- Get industry or media recognition

# Closing Remarks

If you are interested in signing up for one of the pilots, and are willing to commit 10 hours per week writing solid code, please put your name on this spreadsheet so we can gauge interest.
 
This proposal is still being worked out at this time. Please participate in the discussion, and please invite friends who may be interested. Thanks!

This document is essentially a rough draft of the course proposal that we will formally submit to Charlie Clarke for approval for Software Engineers.

TODO: This could be put elsewhere...
