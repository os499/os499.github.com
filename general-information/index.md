<h1 id='about-the-course'>About the course</h1>

This is a [student-organized](#history) course where students at the University of Waterloo contribute to open-source software.

## Project-oriented
The main purpose of the course is for students to get involved with an open-source project and make a meaningful contribution during their term. We currently expect students to work on their project for 10-12 weeks, with at least a 10-hour commitment per week. Contributions are very flexible and open-ended &mdash; students can write code, work on bug fixes, improve documentation, and participate in mailing lists.

## Lectures
We will have weekly meetings where initial lectures are given by the participating professors. The lead professor will have contributed to open-source software, and will attempt to forge industry collaborations and get media coverage. In later lectures, students will give presentations on the projects that they're working on and present lectures on topics in open-source software development. We will also be inviting guest speakers from industry and the open-source community to our weekly meetings.

Possible lecture topics include OSS history, licenses, major projects, tools, advice for new contributors, and development practices.

## Evaluation
At the beginning of the course, students will outline their objectives and set their own deadlines. This will be used as a basis for grading. Since each project will vary and expected student contributions may vary as well, the marking scheme should vary accordingly.

Depending on the student's situation, evaluation may come from the following sources:

- Source control commit logs and diff
- Weekly snippets, email/newsgroup communications
- Mentor evaluation
- Peer evaluations (for team projects)

Students will submit the information above with their final report, which has the main goals of summarizing their interactions with the community and whether their contributions have met the goals they set out.

<!--# How do I enroll?-->
<!--TODO-->
<!--- Project and mentor search-->
  <!--- Students can find their own projects and mentors-->
  <!--- There are OSS projects looking for student contribution. See Google Summer of Code (2011 list) and UCOSP-->
  <!--- Students can also select from a list of projects curated by the lead professor-->
  <!--- Lead professor can assist students in searching for projects and mentors-->
  <!--- We will provide an information page or website that students can reference when applying to projects-->
  <!--- Students should have their project selected before enrolling in the course-->
  <!--- lots of projects on GitHub-->

<!--# Pilot-->
<!--TODO-->
<!--For the pilot, instead of having a centralized, 1 professor to many students model, we will have a distributed many profs to many students model. In this way, we can have a low student-professor ratio and make the course scalable, even if professors do not get teaching credit. This is a necessity now because of the lack of teaching resources in the ECE department, making it difficult for ECE to grant professors teaching credit-->

<!--- two different possibilities-->
<!--- here we describe the other distributed model... multiple profs rotate together-->

<h1 id="history">A bit of history...</h1>
This course is proposed and organized by students at the University of Waterloo. Here's the tale of how it came to be:

> It was a dark and stormy night (actually, not really... it was a typical sunny afternoon in Mountain View, California). I was eating dinner with friends, when, suddenly, I was overcome with a burning desire to contribute to open-source software. Being an engineering student, I don't usually have much time to work on side projects and find it difficult to stick to them as well. It then occurred to me that contributing to open-source software would be a perfect fit for a Software Engineering course. As soon as I finished dinner, I started writing up a proposal for such a course and posted it up on Facebook. This caught the attention of Waterloo's Soft Eng administrator, who &mdash; within 8 hours &mdash; gave his informal approval on the associated Facebook group.

The Facebook group, though not extensively promoted, quickly gained recognition and acquired 60 members. We found out about the existing [UCOSP](http://ucosp.ca), but discovered that it was unable to accommodate all the students who expressed an interest in this course. Thus, throughout the Spring 2011 term, student organizers communicated with professors to make this course into a reality.

We are currently working on developing this website and gearing up for a large pilot in the Fall 2011 term that should accommodate all the interested Soft Eng 2014 students, and possibly smaller pilots before then.
